The application uses maven to manage dependencies. It was built using intellij IDEA but any IDE can be used (just don't checkin IDE files). Additionally to run locally, you will need to set imgur API keys in the ezimgur.v3.api project ImgurApiConstants file. Contact eggman87 for API keys to use.

If you would like to add a feature, please first create a issue in the issues tab so that we can track the progress.

You are also welcome to work on any existing issues - just please make sure they are not being worked on by someone else.
