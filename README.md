ezimgur-open
============

ezimgur android app 

imgur browsing android application. 

This project was initially a side project to learn android, decieded to open-source it so that users can develop their own features if they want to. Keep in mind that the code was originally written for/by one person, so it may contain some bad practices or code smell (cowboy coding!).

All code is free to use as long as it is not used commerically. 

The application uses maven to manage dependencies. It was built using intellij IDEA but any IDE can be used (just don't checkin IDE files). Additionally to run locally, you will need to set imgur API keys in the ezimgur.v3.api project ImgurApiConstants file. Contact eggman87 for API keys to use.

If you would like to add a feature, please first create a issue in the issues tab so that we can track the progress.

You are also welcome to work on any existing issues - just please make sure they are not being worked on by someone else.
