    <string name="about_intro_body">
        Thanks for using ezimgur. This app was developed as a personal nights and weekends side project to learn android. I do not make any money on this
        and I also have a full time job, so please forgive any frustrations you may face as far as bugs or experience.
        Instead, if you do face any issues just drop me a message and I will fix right away.
        I can be reached at ezimgur@gmail.com.\n\nIf you have a feature or suggestion that you want implemented,
        just send me a message and I will add it in the work bucket.

        Here are some helpful hints for using the app:\n\n
        1. When a image is too blurry or not visible, this means the image is huge - try long pressing the center of the image (or at least where the image should be)
        and selecting view fullsize. \n\n
        2. If a GIF is too wide for the screen and trying to scroll changes the image - try viewing in full size using the long press menu item.\n\n
        3. When viewing an album - swipe up and down to scroll through the album images.\n\n
        4. Some phones disable GIFs in the android webview. If your phone does this, gifs will not be animated.
